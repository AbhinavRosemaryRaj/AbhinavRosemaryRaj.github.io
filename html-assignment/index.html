        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I come from Kerala, the so-called God's own country in India, known for its lush green landscapes and backwaters. My recreations are playing video games, listening to music, researching the history and watching football. One of my life goals always has been to travel around Europe to experience diverse cultures with my family.</p>
        <p>Since 12<sup>th</sup> grade, my passion for digital design started to grow, so I decided to put the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program as a
             stepping stone for my career. And by working on my skills in this field, I look forward to leaving my mark in this industry to inspire others.</p>
